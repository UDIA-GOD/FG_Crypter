# FG_Crypter

FG_Crypter is a Python-based crypter that uses AES-256 bit encryption to encrypt executable files.

## Usage

1. Install Python on your Windows PC or laptop. Make sure to check the "add to path" option during installation.
2. Download this repository to your computer or laptop (Windows only).
3. Alternatively, you can download the latest release without cloning the entire repository.
4. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the repository.
5. Open the command prompt and run the following command:
```
pip install requirements.txt
```
This will install the required dependencies.

## Features

The FG_Crypter offers the following options:

1. Encrypt an executable file.
2. Decrypt an encrypted executable file. Make sure to save the encryption key, as it will be lost if not preserved.
3. Quit the program.

## Executable

For users who cannot execute Python code directly, an executable file called "FG_Crypter.exe" is available in the releases section of this repository.
